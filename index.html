<p>I'm a Software Quality Engineer for my favorite nonprofit in Charlottesville: the <a href="http://centerforopenscience.org/">Center for Open Science</a> (COS), which is also a sleek tech startup with a mission to change science for the better. I may spend my days trying to make our <a href="https://osf.io/">Open Science Framework</a> a more robust tool for scientists and researchers, but I didn't start out in the tech industry. I received my BA and MA in English from the University of Virginia and always thought I was slated for a job in the book industry or the academic world. When I found myself at the Center for Open Science two years after graduating, I felt my heart tugging in a direction it had never been tugged before. I liked the fast-paced and mission-driven approach COS took to building technology for the scientific community. Yes, it was technology. Yes, my background was in the humanities. And yet, here was a chance to try something new. I was irresistibly pulled in.</p>
