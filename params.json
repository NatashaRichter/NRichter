{"name":"Natasha Richter","tagline":"","body":"## ### A bit about me\r\nI'm a Software Quality Engineer for my favorite nonprofit in Charlottesville: the [Center for Open Science](http://centerforopenscience.org/) (COS), which is also a sleek tech startup with a mission to change science for the better. I may spend my days trying to make our [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/) a more robust tool for scientists and researchers, but I didn't start out in the tech industry. I received my BA and MA in English from the University of Virginia and always thought I was slated for a job in the book industry or the academic world. When I found myself at the Center for Open Science two years after graduating, I felt my heart tugging in a direction it had never been tugged before. I liked the fast-paced and mission-driven approach COS took to building technology for the scientific community. Yes, it was technology. Yes, my background was in the humanities. And yet, here was a chance to try something new. I was irresistibly pulled in.\r\n\r\n### Things I like\r\n\r\nI like to read, meditate, play keyboard, sing, and help my husband (@kaw2k) cook. My life is built around my yoga practice, which I start my day with and end my day with--every day. I practice bhakti yoga, which is based around mantra meditation. However, I also practice stretching yoga (hatha) for health and wellness. You can find me leading short daily 10-15 minute stretching breaks at COS to restore focus and therefore increase work efficiency.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nContact me at nlr9t@virginia.edu about anything COS, food, or yoga related.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
